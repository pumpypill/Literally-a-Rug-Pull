## Overview

LITERALLY A RUG PULL (.fun) represents the apotheosis of meta-commentary in the Web3 ecosystem. This project employs advanced memetic engineering and behavioral economics to create an immersive experience that interrogates the intersection of speculative finance and collective delusion.

## Core Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Disappointment Protocol**: Revolutionary consensus mechanism ensuring maximum investor disenchantment
- **AI-Powered Hopium Distribution**: Machine learning algorithms optimized for temporal excitement decay

- **Deflationary Enthusiasm Model**: Tokenomics designed for progressive value extraction
- **Biometric Cope Detection**: Advanced sentiment analysis for real-time market manipulation

## Technical Architecture

Built on a microservices architecture leveraging:
- Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal SEO and performance
- TypeScript for type-safe disappointment handling
- Tailwind CSS implementing Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Framer Motion for OpenAI-inspired smooth animations
- Web3 integration with ethers.js and wagmi
- Vercel deployment with edge computing optimization

## Design Philosophy

The interface draws inspiration from:
- Apple's spatial computing design language
- OpenAI's minimalist aesthetic principles
- Bauhaus-influenced geometric brutalism
- Post-digital skeuomorphism with subtle neumorphic elements

## Getting Started
